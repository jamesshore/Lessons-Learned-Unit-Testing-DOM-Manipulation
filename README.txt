This repository contains the example code for the "Lessons Learned: Unit Testing DOM Manipulation Code" episode of James Shore's "Let's Code: Test-Driven Javascript" screencast. For details, the video, and a transcript, see http://letscodejavascript.com .

To run the tests, open two terminal windows and a web browser.
 - In the first, run "./jake.sh testacular" (or "jake.bat testacular" on Windows) to start the test server.
 - Point the web browser at "http://localhost:8080".
 - In the second, run "./jake.sh loose=true" (or "jake.bat loose=true") to run the tests.
